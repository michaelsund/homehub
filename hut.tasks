☐ New sensors and recurringevents should be added from setting panel later on (manual add in db for now)
☐ Write api part for sensor adding, editing, delete (removes all measurements aswell), adding values.
☐ Checkout express-validator for validating post input, implement if its any good.
☐ If a change to the grid is made, it does not load the latest change if switching to About and back to App.
☐ Setup dockercontainers for node (with telldusd) and mongodb, forward tellstick to node container.
